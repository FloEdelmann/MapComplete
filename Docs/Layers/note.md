 note 
======





This layer shows notes on OpenStreetMap. Having this layer in your theme will trigger the 'add new note' functionality in the 'addNewPoint'-popup (or if your theme has no presets, it'll enable adding notes)






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **10** and higher
  - <img src='../warning.svg' height='1rem'/> This layer is loaded from an external source, namely  `https://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/notes.json?limit=10000&closed=7&bbox={x_min},{y_min},{x_max},{y_max}`
